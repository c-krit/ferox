A 2D collision detection and physics library written in C.

**WARNING: This library is in an early alpha stage, use it at your own risk.**

## Features

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-krit/ferox/main/examples/res/images/bricks.gif" width="640" alt="Bricks!">

**Since this project was made to learn how a physics engine works, I am not planning to add a lot of features to it.**

- Broad-phase collision detection with spatial hashing algorithm
- Narrow-phase collision detection with SAT (Separating Axis Theorem)
- 'Sequential Impulse' iterative constraint solver
- Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler integrator

## Prerequisites

- GCC version 9.4.0+
- GNU Make version 4.1+
- Git version 2.17.1+

```console
$ sudo apt install build-essential git
```

### Optional

Make sure you have installed [raylib 3.7.0+](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to compile all examples.

## Building

This project uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) as the build system.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/c-krit/ferox
$ cd ferox
$ make
```

You can also build this library as standalone-mode to avoid `raylib.h` header inclusion and functions that depend on raylib:

```console
$ make BUILD=STANDALONE
```

### Cross-compiling for Windows

Make sure to set the value of `RAYLIB_PATH` variable to cross-compile for Windows:

```console
$ make RAYLIB_PATH=../raylib TARGET_OS=WINDOWS
```
